Team Assignment 1: Data Visualization
=====================================

Description
-----------

You will work with a (randomly assigned) partner to write a short blog post that contains (at least) one data graphic. Your goal is to tell the class something interesting using a well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphic. One data graphic should suffice, but you may include more if you choose.

Your blog post should be short---I envision an introductory paragraph that explains your findings and provides some context to your data, the data graphic(s), and then a caption-like paragraph providing more detail about what to look for in the data graphic and how to interpret it. That's it. You will not earn more points by including more words or data graphics. What I'm looking for is something that is insightful and well-crafted. As always, you should spend some time thinking about context, scale, color, etc.

You should write your blog post in R Markdown and create your data graphic using `ggplot2`. You will upload your R Markdown (.Rmd) and markdown (.md) files to GitHub. Do not forget to give your post an informative title!

You should show your code in your blog post, but only the minimal code necessary to produce your plot---not all the code that you wrote in the process of doing this assignment!

Data
----

You are free to use whatever data you want. However, the purpose of this exercise is to learn how to make good data graphics, not to wrangle data (don't worry, we're headed there next). So I don't want you to spend much time wrangling data. There are perfectly good data sets available through R packages that are already well-curated:

-   `nycflights13`: data about flights leaving from the three major NYC airports in 2013
-   `babynames`: history of baby names from the Social Security Administration
-   `Lahman`: comprehensive historical archive of major league baseball data
-   `fueleconomy`: fuel economy data from the EPA, 1985â€“2015
-   `fivethirtyeight`: provides access to data sets that drive many articles on FiveThirtyEight.
