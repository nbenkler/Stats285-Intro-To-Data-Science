Team Assignment 2: Data Wrangling

(The below description was adapted from [APM Reports' data repository](https://github.com/APM-Reports/jury-data).)

In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Batson v. Kentucky that it is unconstitutional for prosecutors to use race as a reason for exercising peremptory strikes against African-American potential jurors. Despite the court’s Batson ruling, research has found that there are still large disparities in the way that prosecutors and defense attorneys treat jurors of different races.

Journalists working on the APM Reports podcast “In The Dark” spent a year gathering and analyzing court records to build a data set of peremptory strikes in the Fifth Circuit Court District of Mississippi from 1992 through 2017. This analysis was done as part of a larger investigation into the case of Curtis Flowers, a man who has been tried six times for the 1996 murder of four people in Winona, Mississippi. Three convictions were overturned on appeal and two other trials ended in a hung jury. Each time, Flowers was retried. The Mississippi Supreme Court overturned Flowers’ conviction three times. In one of those rulings, the court found that District Attorney Doug Evans committed a Batson violation by striking jurors because of their race.

Our goal was to use our toolkit to determine whether prosecutors’ use of race in jury selection in the Flowers case was part of a larger pattern in the Fifth Circuit Court District of Mississippi during Evans’ tenure.

This project produces an (about) 3 page report that provides insight into whether prosecutors’ use of race in jury selection in the Flowers case was part of a larger pattern in the Fifth Circuit Court District of Mississippi during Evans’ tenure.

The data are provided in APM Reports' GitHub repository for their [jury selection analysis](https://github.com/APM-Reports/jury-data). The README file includes a version of the above overview as well as data dictionaries.
